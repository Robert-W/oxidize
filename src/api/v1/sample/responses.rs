/// This module is meant as an example of how to have a separate response struct
/// from the model struct. This is not always necessary, and in the case of the
/// Sample struct, it is not.  This pattern is more common when you don't want
/// to return all the values in your struct, or you need to filter some of them
/// based on permissions. Use whatever pattern suits your need.
